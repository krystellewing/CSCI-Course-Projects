Welcome to my Computer Science Course Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed as part of various Computer Science and Math courses. Each project showcases my skills and knowledge in different areas of study. Below, you will find a brief overview of the projects. Please note that these projects are not the only projects that were completed during my time in undergrad but are projects that I feel are relevant to the career in data analytics and design that I am interested in.

Introduction to Computer Science - Final Project

***Are Droughts Only Popular in the West?***

In 2020, my intro Computer Science course final project was to develop a research question that related to weather and/or natural disasters. We were required to read in data from CSVs and plot data within our Python program using Matplotlib. I decided to research how common U.S. droughts were in locations other than western states. For my research, I focused on the states of Arizona, California, Oregon, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Maine. After implementing data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site into CSV files and reading the data into my Python program, it was proven that droughts are most common in the West except for Texas, a southern state that was in similar drought categories as the West.

Statistics and Engineering - Final Project

***Does Alcohol Consumption Effect Student Grades in Portugal?***

In fall 2021, my Statistics course final project was to develop two research questions that followed a data sample of our choice and complete a full statistical analysis of it including our results, ANOVA, Q-Q plots, scatterplots, our hypothesis, and regression. The statistics folder contains the full report as a pdf. 
  
New Orleans in Twelve Movements Summer Course - Final Project

***Crescent City to the City of Angels***

In summer 2023, I took a course that focused on the history, geography, and musicality that came out of New Orleans to date. The requirements of the final project were to choose a topic that focused on three aspects of the city (music/art, environment/engineering, history) while using ArcGIS to create a storymap rather than a PowerPoint. My project focused on the migration of New Orleanians to Los Angeles during the Great Migration and beyond, with many migrating using the emerging railroad systems from the 1800s to go West and seek better opportunity. There is a link to the storymap via ArcGis within the NOLA-ArcGIS-Project file.
