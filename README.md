Welcome to my Computer Science Course Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed as part of various courses. Each project showcases my skills and knowledge in different areas of study. Below, you will find a brief overview of the projects, along with instructions on how to set up and run them. This is also a living repository, as I am still transferring projects from my GitLab account to this GitHub account.

Introduction to Computer Science - Final Project
***Are Droughts Only Popular in the West?***
In 2020, my intro Computer Science course final project was to develop a research question that related to weather and/or natural disasters. We were required to read in data from CSVs and plot data within our Python program using Matplotlib. I decided to research how common U.S. droughts were in locations other than western states. For my research, I focused on the states of Arizona, California, Oregon, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Maine. After implementing data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site into CSV files and reading the data into my Python program, it was proven that droughts are most common in the West except for Texas, a southern state that was in similar drought categories as the West.
